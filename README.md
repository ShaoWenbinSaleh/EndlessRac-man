# EndlessRac-man
All-Script Unity project

"All-Script" means everything on the game scenes is generated programmatically instead of importing other files.
The codes can be understood without knowledge about Unity. 
This game can be run after just adding "GameLoop.cs" to the MainCamera of default scene.
This is an endless maze game similar to the classical game "Pac-man".
It is still incomplete.
